# SKYSURF Sky-SB Estimation Algorithm

These codes are used to estimate the sky surface brightness from an image. Please refer 
to [O'Brien et al. (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221008010O/abstract) for details on the
algorithm. The Jupyter Notebook shows how to run these codes on some test data.
